### Migration

This was on shared hosting in [appy.py](https://github.com/inceabdullah/Haber-Tellali-3th-Wave-News-Service/blob/master/flask/appy.py)
But it is migrated to [aws-fargate-docker-container/flask/Flask-fetch_img_with_rszd/appy.py](aws-fargate-docker-container/flask/Flask-fetch_img_with_rszd/)

**API** endpoint is changed `http://haber.ozguruygulama.com/fetch_img_with_rszd` to `http://18.184.179.85/` [92f9dee](https://github.com/inceabdullah/Haber-Tellali-3th-Wave-News-Service/commit/92f9dee409dd216d5615df92254f71099830fde1).
